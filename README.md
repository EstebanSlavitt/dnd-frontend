## 🚧 Challenges and Learnings

As a junior developer, this project helped me enhance my skills in React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. It also deepened my understanding of API integration and creating dynamic, responsive web applications. I am proud of the UI/UX and the overall speed of the app, which makes character creation much faster and enjoyable for players. Additionally, working with Ruby on Rails in the back end has strengthened my full-stack development skills.
